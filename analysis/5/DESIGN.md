# Ultra-Simple Investigation Dashboard - One Command, Maximum WOW

## Problem / Metric

Current EDA tools require multiple commands and produce fragmented outputs that don't impress investigators or provide immediate actionable insights:
- Multiple scripts needed to understand a case
- Technical outputs (JSON, CSV) instead of investigation-ready insights  
- No single "case overview" that makes investigators go "WOW!"
- Directory limitations prevent analyzing real case data

**Current State**: Run 5+ commands, get technical data fragments
**Target State**: Run ONE command, get stunning investigation dashboard

## Goal

Create a single, powerful command that transforms any investigation case into an impressive, actionable dashboard:
1. **One command**: `python investigate_case.py --case-dir ./data/gantry`
2. **One output**: Beautiful HTML investigation dashboard
3. **Zero complexity**: No technical knowledge required
4. **Maximum impact**: Makes investigators immediately understand their case

## Scope (M/S/W)

### Must Have [M]
- [M] Transform `check_all_communications.py` into `investigate_case.py`
- [M] Single HTML dashboard output with embedded visualizations
- [M] Data quality assessment with confidence scoring
- [M] Communication timeline with behavioral insights
- [M] Key players identification and relationship mapping
- [M] Content highlights with suspicious pattern detection

### Should Have [S]
- [S] Export dashboard as PDF for case files
- [S] Command-line summary for quick terminal viewing
- [S] Comparison mode for multiple cases

### Won't Do [W]
- [W] Multiple output files or formats
- [W] Complex configuration or setup
- [W] Separate scripts for different analysis types
- [W] External dependencies or complex visualizations
- [W] Real-time monitoring or ML predictions

## Acceptance Criteria

| # | Given | When | Then |
|---|-------|------|------|
| 1 | Gantry case directory with sessions.ndjson and LanceDB | Runs `investigate_case.py --case-dir ./data/gantry` | Gets stunning HTML dashboard in <10 seconds |
| 2 | Any investigator (non-technical) | Opens the HTML report | Immediately understands case scope, key players, and suspicious patterns |
| 3 | Case with data quality issues | Runs investigation command | Dashboard clearly shows data gaps and reliability scores |
| 4 | Case with 67K+ sessions | Runs investigation command | Dashboard loads quickly with key insights highlighted |
| 5 | Investigator needs case summary | Runs with `--summary` flag | Gets 10-line terminal summary of key findings |
| 6 | Multiple cases to compare | Runs `--compare case1 case2` | Gets side-by-side comparison dashboard |

## Technical Design

### Single Script Architecture: `investigate_case.py`

```python
# Ultra-simple command interface
python investigate_case.py --case-dir ./data/gantry                    # Full dashboard
python investigate_case.py --case-dir ./data/gantry --summary          # Terminal summary  
python investigate_case.py --compare ./data/gantry ./data/btk          # Case comparison
```

üî• Highest activity: Monday 9-11 AM, Wednesday 2-4 PM
‚ö†Ô∏è Suspicious spike: January 5th (10x normal volume)
```

**4. Key Players Network**
```
üë• Primary Investigation Targets
1. @Omar Fisher - 15,342 messages (23%) - Hub communicator
2. @Sarah Chen - 8,567 messages (13%) - Early morning patterns  
3. @Mike Torres - 4,231 messages (6%) - Coordination role

```

**5. Communication Patterns**
```
üì± Message Breakdown
- Text Messages: 62,046 (92%) - Primary communication method
- Phone Calls: 4,917 (7%) - Used for sensitive topics
- Emails: 0 (0%) - No email communications detected

‚è∞ Behavioral Insights
- Peak activity: 9 AM, 2 PM, 7 PM (work + personal patterns)
- Response time: 4.2 minutes average
- Weekend activity: 23% lower than weekdays
```

**6. Content Intelligence**
```
üîç Key Investigation Terms
High Frequency: "meeting" (1,247), "delivery" (891), "urgent" (456)
Suspicious Patterns: "clean phone" (23), "cash only" (67), "usual place" (134)

üìã Message Categories  
- Routine: 70% (logistics, scheduling)
- Urgent: 15% (time-sensitive coordination)
- Suspicious: 15% (coded language, unusual patterns)
```

**7. Investigative Recommendations**
```
üéØ RECOMMENDED ACTIONS
1. Focus on January 5th spike - unusual activity detected
2. Investigate @Omar Fisher hub role - central coordinator
3. Analyze "cash only" messages - potential financial crimes
4. Review early morning @Sarah Chen patterns - shift work or covert timing
